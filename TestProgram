#For this, this is supposed to be a test program used for the buttons and LED lights. It is expected that once you press the button, a line saying "button is pressed" should
#appear, meaning the button works, and the LED light connected to port 18 should light up. If it is not pressed, a line saying "button was not pressed." should appear, and the
#LED light connected to port 23 should light up.
