**This is a guide for a simple Christmas Present, using Raspberry Pi and possibly PuTTY.**
# Purpose
The initial purpose of this project is to help children who are suffering from vision disabilities and who doesn't have access to adequate education.

# Description
This present is composed of a raspberry pi, an USB cord, a breadboard, a t-cobbler, 2 resisitors, 2 LED lights, 7 wires, and one button.
A box *could* be designed at your discretion in order to cover the wiring, and making the present more asthetically pleasing. A guide for the box that we designed would also be attached. However, the present would work **perfectly** without a box or any decorations.
The program and the parts combined would allow the present to perform the following task:
- Light & Color recognization test
- Basic math test
- Basic English test
- All test questions are at a randomized order, with LED light feedback, and clear word instructions.

**Please Note: All steps needs to be followed exactly, care needs to be taken when following those steps as electricity is involved.**

# Guide - Physical
This part of the guide focuses on the physical wiring and designing of the breadboard & raspberry pi.
- Gather Materials, as listed above.
- connect the t-cobbler to both the breadboard and the raspberry pi, as seen in the picture.
